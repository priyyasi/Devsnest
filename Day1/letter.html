       With due respect I Pranjal Gupta of IT branch second year wants to inform you that Devsnest is orgainising
       is a 30 day code camp for beginners. I attended this camp the past month was overwhelmed by the quality of
       knowledge I gained during this short time. So, I request you to please grant the permission so that they can 
       organise this camp for the students of our Instution. So, kindly grant them the permission to organise the camp.
